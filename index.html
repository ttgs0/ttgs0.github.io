        <div class="title">Introduction</div>
        <div class="text2">Chinese culture is vast and profound, with a rich history spanning thousands of years. However, in modern times, numerous precious cultural relics have been lost overseas due to various historical reasons, becoming a source of pain for the Chinese people. The bronze animal heads, as significant representatives of these relics, symbolize the splendor and glory of Chinese culture. Five of these bronze heads are still scattered abroad, awaiting their return to their homeland to fulfill the long-cherished dream of coming home.</div>
        <div class="text2 emphasis">The Totem (ToTem) Community has emerged as a global non-profit organization initiated and supported by Chinese people worldwide. Our mission is to contribute to the revival and development of Chinese civilization by preserving, inheriting, and promoting Chinese culture. The establishment of the Totem Community signifies the start of an unprecedented philanthropic initiative: leveraging cutting-edge Web3 blockchain technology to trace and reclaim the bronze animal heads that remain lost overseas, and bring them back to their rightful home.</div>

    <div class="main main3">
        <div class="title">Background</div>
        <div class="text1">1、The Importance and Global Impact of Chinese Cultural Relics</div>
        <div class="text2">Chinese cultural relics hold a significant place not only in China but also as treasures of the world's cultural heritage. They showcase China's contributions in areas such as art, craftsmanship, technology, and social organization, having a profound and far-reaching impact on the development of world civilization.</div>
        <img src="images/main3_1.png" alt="">
        <div class="text2">Through the dissemination and exchange of these relics, many Chinese techniques, ideas, and art forms have influenced and inspired cultural development worldwide.</div>
        <div class="text1">2、The Current Situation and Challenges of Chinese Cultural Relics Lost Overseas</div>
        <div class="text2">Since ancient times, Chinese cultural relics have been admired as treasures of world heritage. Unfortunately, due to historical upheavals, wars, and illegal transactions, a significant number of precious artifacts have been lost overseas. These relics are scattered across museums, private collections, and auction markets around the world, forming a vast and complex network of Chinese cultural artifacts abroad. It is roughly estimated that the number of Chinese cultural relics lost overseas exceeds one million pieces.</div>
        <div class="text2">These cultural relics, long adrift overseas, face the dual risks of natural and human-induced damage. During transportation, display, and preservation, some artifacts have unfortunately been damaged and even face the possibility of total loss. This is not only a significant loss for Chinese culture but also an irreparable harm to the cultural heritage of humanity.</div>
        <img class="img" src="images/main3_2.webp" alt="">
        <div class="text2">However, the cross-border retrieval of cultural relics lost overseas is a daunting and complex task. The vast differences in legal systems and judicial practices between countries add to the difficulty of reclaiming these artifacts. In practice, it is also necessary to coordinate multiple interests, and the high economic value of these relics further complicates the process of their return.</div>
        <div class="text2">Although China has joined international conventions such as the 1970 UNESCO Convention, issues regarding the retroactive effect and binding force of these conventions remain unresolved, and there are many challenges in their practical application.</div>
        <div class="text1">3、The Application of Blockchain Technology in Cultural Relic Preservation</div>
        <div class="text2">With the rapid development of blockchain technology, the field of cultural relic preservation has ushered in new changes. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized, immutable, transparent, and traceable characteristics, offers new solutions for the protection of cultural relics, greatly enhancing the efficiency and credibility of preservation efforts.</div>
        <div class="text2">The decentralized nature of blockchain makes it possible to build a global network for cultural heritage preservation.</div>
        <div class="text2">This network can gather global cultural institutions, experts, collectors, and enthusiasts to collectively participate in the preservation, tracking, and restoration of cultural artifacts. Through a decentralized network, information on cultural heritage preservation can be disseminated and shared more widely, thereby enhancing efficiency and collaboration in protection efforts.</div>
        <img class="img" src="images/main3_3.webp" alt="">
        <div class="text2">Blockchain technology can also use token incentive mechanisms to encourage more people to participate in cultural heritage preservation efforts. For instance, in a tokenized community like Totem, participants can earn TTGS tokens as community rewards by contributing clues, providing expertise, and engaging in restoration activities. This incentive mechanism not only boosts public participation but also provides sustained motivation and resources for cultural heritage preservation.</div>
        <div class="text2">In the context of globalization, the application of blockchain technology will inject new vitality into cultural heritage preservation efforts, promoting the sustainable development of cultural heritage and facilitating cross-border cooperation.</div>
